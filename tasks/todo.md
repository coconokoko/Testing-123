# Personal Designer Portfolio Website - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Building a minimal, highly interactive designer portfolio website with smooth animations and responsive design.

## Prerequisites & Questions
- [ ] **UI Design File**: Need the attached UI design to implement visual details accurately

- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Install required dependencies (Framer Motion, styling solution)
- [ ] Set up project folder structure
- [ ] Configure base styling and typography
- [ ] Set up responsive breakpoints

### Phase 2: Core Layout & Structure
- [ ] Create main layout component
- [ ] Implement navigation component
- [ ] Set up routing for sections (Home, About, Work, Contact)
- [ ] Create responsive grid system

### Phase 3: Home Section
- [ ] Implement hero section with text reveal animations
- [ ] Add animated role text carousel
- [ ] Create scroll-based motion effects

### Phase 4: About Me Section

- [ ] Ensure typography scales properly
- [ ] Verify animations work on all devices

### Phase 9: Polish & Optimization
- [ ] Review code structure and cleanliness
- [ ] Optimize performance (load time, animation smoothness)
- [ ] Test across browsers
- [ ] Final responsive checks
- [ ] Security review (no sensitive data, no .env files)

### Phase 10: Documentation & Review

- [ ] Document component structure
- [ ] Create Review section in this file
- [ ] Explain all changes and functionality

## Notes
- Following minimal design principles - no visual clutter
- Focus on smooth, intentional animations
- All code should be simple and maintainable
- Frontend-only (no backend logic)
- Will wait for UI design attachment before implementing visual details
