🧠 Pre-Coding Rules (Scan Result – Cleaned)

First, think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
Always ask questions if anything is unclear, and NEVER ASSUME.

The plan should include a list of TODO items that can be checked off as they are completed.

Before beginning any work, check in with me and wait for me to verify the plan.

After approval, begin working on the TODO items, marking them as complete as you go.

At every step, provide a high-level explanation of what changes were made.

Make every task and code change as simple as possible.
Avoid massive or complex changes.
Every change should impact as little code as possible.
Everything is about simplicity.

Ensure security is always tight and production-ready, no matter the circumstance.

Before coding, always think from this perspective:
“What would Mark Zuckerberg do in this situation?”

After execution:

Review all the code you wrote

Ensure it follows security best practices

Confirm there is no sensitive information exposed on the frontend

Ensure there are no vulnerabilities

Ensure no crucial files (such as .env) are included

Double-check everything before pushing to GitHub

Explain the functionality and code in detail

Walk me through what you changed and how it works

Explain like a senior engineer teaching a 16-year-old

Finally, add a Review section to the todo.md file summarizing:

The changes made

Any important notes or relevant information
